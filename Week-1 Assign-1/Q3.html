    <!-- 1. Tags  : - 

     Tags are used to define different parts of an HTML document. They are enclosed in angle brackets and come in pairs, with a start tag and an end tag. 
        
   For example, the <h1> tag is used to define a heading in a web page and is written as <h1>Heading</h1>. The text "Heading" is the content of the <h1> element. -->


    <!-- 
        2 .Elements :- 

    Elements are made up of opening and closing tags and everything in between. They define the structure of a web page and can be nested inside each other. For example, the <ul> and <li> tags are used to create an unordered list in HTML. The <ul> tag is the parent element, and the <li> tag is the child element, like this: -->
        
  <h3>Elements : </h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Item 1</li>
          <li>Item 2</li>
          <li>Item 3</li>
        </ul>


 
           3 . Attributes: -
            Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are specified in the opening tag and consist of a name and a value separated by an equals sign. For example, the <img> tag is used to display an image on a web page, and the "src" attribute is used to specify the URL of the image file.

            The tag is written as <img src="image.jpg">, where "image.jpg" is the value of the "src" attribute.
